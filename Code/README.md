# Project Code Overview
This repository contains Python code for the project, including functions, simulations and plots generation. Before running any simulations or analyses, please ensure that all required packages and functions are installed and loaded in the first block.

## Key Information:
- Each block of code is clearly commented, with detailed explanations at the start of each block. These comments explain the purpose of the code, such as:
  - Generating specific plots in the report
  - Running one example of the simulated data
  - Running simulation experiments for the extension analysis 

Please make sure all dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the code. fs1    q        fvcw
